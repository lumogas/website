		<p>Hello, my name is Karl Schudeck, in spite of which I am Spanish, and I am a 3D artist based in London. I have worked with Max, Maya and XSI, in films, commercials and TV series, for the most part. For the last couple years I have done a lot of previs work at the Third Floor and Argon VFX in London.<label for="mn-00" class="margin-toggle">&#x21E3;</label>
		    <input type="checkbox" id="mn-00" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="marginnote">Their work is worth checking out, by the way. You can find it <a href="https://thethirdfloorinc.com/"> here</a> and <a href="https://www.argonfx.com/"> here</a>.</span></p>
		<p>I spent two and a half years in Montreal, working at Singing Frog, Folks VFX, and Mr X. They were all Maya based. As a result of this experience, I no longer find snow as exotic as I once did, and can now finally read and often make myself understood in French.</p>
		<p>Previs relies on using all the tools available to produce a narrative structure that works and that helps save time during the film shoot. In the case of the Third Floor, that implies a workflow based on Maya, Photoshop, After Effects and Nuke.<label for="mn-01" class="margin-toggle">&#x21E3;</label>
		    <input type="checkbox" id="mn-01" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="marginnote"><em>Postvis</em> implies creating as close an impression of what the final shot will look like so the client can easily assess whether it is worth proceeding with final effects work on that shot or not.</span></p>
		<p>I would describe myself as an animation-centered Maya generalist, with a fascination for storytelling.</p>

		<p>Thanks for dropping by!</p>
