	    <section>
		<h3>Rise of animals, Juramaya</h3>
		<p>This was done for Zoo VFX in London, for a BBC series. The deadlines were always extremely tight, requiring endless shots lasting, sometimes , in excess of fifteen seconds. They were a lot of fun though. In this case I rigged and animated the character in Maya.</p>

		<h3>Hueverto</h3>
		<p>This was a personal project done in my spare time. Displacements done in Zbrush, rendering done in Arnold, textures painted in Photoshop and Zbrush, comping done in Nuke, modeling and animation done in Maya. I am a huge fan of Inca architecture, which inspired the building in the background.</p>

		<h3>Goleo</h3>
		<p>A project done in Munich at Liga 01 (they have since joined with Sehsucht) using XSI with Goleo, the World Cup mascot at the time. I only did animation on this. I miss XSI, which I still think had the best animation tools in 3D.</p>

		<h3>Rise of Animals, Tiktaalik</h3>
		<p>For the same episode as the mouse guy, I rigged, laid out and animated out a series of shots featuring the first creature to set 'foot' on land. It was interesting sending the tests back to the scientists for their views on how the motions of the creature would have been like. The collaboration with the render artist was especially enjoyable.</p>

		<h3>Citroen Diesel</h3>
		<p>Another job done at Liga 01 in Munich using XSI. I only animated on that project. They set up their own 'crowd' system for shots that would feature a sea of pigs to simulate traffic on the roads (the idea being that other cars are really dirty).</p>
		<figure>
		    <label for="break_05" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label><input type="checkbox" id="break_05" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="marginnote">No pigs were harmed in the making of this ad</span>

		</figure>
		<h3>Brother printers</h3>
		<p>This was my first job at The Mill. It involved creating a series of unfolding animations (using blend shapes) and then placing them on the plate so they would look interesting. It was as time consuming as it sounds. Animated using XSI.</p>
		<figure>
		    <label for="break_06" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label><input type="checkbox" id="break_06" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="marginnote">From The Mill</span>
		    <img src="images/breakdown_06.png" alt="An image of a guy watching unfolding paper" />
		</figure>
		<h3>Five Children and It</h3>
		<p>This was done in Henson's at London using Maya. Originally, the volume of CG shots was going to be much lower because they were originally planning to do as much as possible with a live action puppet, but the CG creature looked so much better that it replaced many of those shots. I only did animation on this project.</p>
		<figure>
		    <label for="break_07" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label><input type="checkbox" id="break_07" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="marginnote">From Jim Henson's Creature Shop</span>
		    <img src="images/breakdown_07.png" alt="An image of It" />
		</figure>
		<h3>"Muller, wonderful stuff"</h3>
		<p>A yoghurt commercial done at The Mill, where the premise was "more is more". I did most of the 3D characters in this shot. I was also assigned with doling out the other shots to the numerous team of animators working on that project at the time. This was animated in XSI.</p>
		<figure>
		    <label for="break_08" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label><input type="checkbox" id="break_08" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="marginnote">From The Mill</span>
		    <img src="images/breakdown_08.png" alt="A picture overladed with stuff" />
		</figure>
		<h3>Volkswagen 'Black Betty'</h3>
		<p>Also at The Mill, also done with XSI (they were doing some jobs in Maya too, at the time), a commercial for Volkswagen. I only animated on this project, in this case, all the insects featured in the shot.</p>
		<figure>
		    <label for="break_09" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label><input type="checkbox" id="break_09" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="marginnote">From The Mill</span>
		    <img src="images/breakdown_09.png" alt="An image of lots of scurrying insects" />
		</figure>
		<h3>Night at the Museum</h3>
		<p>Another David Attenborough project done at Zoo VFX, though this time only doing layout and animation. The shot is meant to empahsize that Smilodons were social animals. The premise of the show is some of the exhibits coming alive and using that as a pretext to explain what their behaviour might have been like. Done in Maya.</p>

		    <label for="break_10" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label><input type="checkbox" id="break_10" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="marginnote">From BBC, <em>Natural History Museum, Alive</em></span>
